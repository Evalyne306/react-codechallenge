## Title
Bank of Flatiron

# Description

In this Bank App i have implemented a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react.
# Core Deliverables
As a user, you can:

-See a table of all transactions.

-Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
-Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
